The W3C WebDriver API is a platform and language-neutral interface and wire protocol allowing programs or scripts to control the behavior of a web browser.<br/>

WebDriver enables developers to create automated tests that simulate user interaction. This is different from JavaScript unit tests because WebDriver has access to functionality and information that JavaScript running in the browser doesn't, and it can more accurately simulate user events or OS-level events. WebDriver can also manage testing across multiple windows, tabs and webpages in a single test session.<br/>

### Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML)<br/>

Microsoft WebDriver for Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) versions 18 and 19 is a Windows Feature on Demand which ensures that it’s always up to date automatically and enables some new ways to get Microsoft WebDriver. To get started you will have to enable Developer Mode:<br/>
Go to Settings > Update and Security > For Developer and then select “Developer mode”.<br/>

For Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) builds prior to 18, install a previous release of WebDriver:<br/>

To find your correct build number: Launch Microsoft Edge and navigate to edge://settings/help or click ... > Settings >  About Microsoft Edge, to view the Chromium version. Having the correct version of WebDriver for your build ensures it runs correctly.<br/>
